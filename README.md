You can show your opinion and give a thumb up of a thumb down

## How to run it locally
> Just run the command
`npm run inicio`

>If you are using a windows machine of if you see that the application doesn't start, open 2 separated terminals and run one of these commands a terminal 
- `npm run json-server`

## What I did
> This application was created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to set up the initial application, Y used [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to handle the information through the application, for the styles I decided to use [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/) because it isolates the styles making easier to use CSS, Finally to store the data and fetch the celebrities for the first time [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) was the solution
